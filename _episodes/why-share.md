title: Why should researchers share their code?
teaching: 15
exercises: 15
duration: 0
summary: 'In this lesson we consider some of the reasons why people share code
  and software, and the concerns about and barriers to sharing code. We will
  also consider what makes code "good". '
questions:
  - |-
    Why are the benefits for sharing code?
    Why don't researchers make their code public?
    What attributes does code have to be considered "good"?
objectives:
  - >-
    To identify the benefits that you would realise if you made your code
    available.

    To identify the barriers that current stop you from making your code available.

    To identify what steps needs to be take to write good code "worthy" of posting publicly.
keypoints:
  - People share code and software for many reasons
  - Some of the barriers to sharing software are personal and some institutional.
  - |
    Good code is obtainable by any programmer regardless of experience. 
  - They are a number of small steps that can be taken to prepare your code for
    sharing.

> ## Enumerating the benefits `10 min`
> In small groups, try to think of reasons people share code and software.
> Using the <a href="{{ site.collaborative_notes }}" target="_blank">collaborative notes document</a>,
> jot down any ideas you come up with, so that we have an overall list at the end.
> > ## Ideas
> > Some reasons that are commonly cited are:
> > - Shared software can be built on by others
> > - Shared code can be checked by others
> > - Shared software can be maintained by others
> > - Extensions to some software have to be shared due to copyleft licensing
> > - It's possible to audit and verify shared software
> > - Sharing software helps you hold yourself to higher coding standards

> ## Considering the concerns `10 min`
> In the same groups, try to think of reasons people might hesitate to share code or software.
> Again, use the <a href="{{ site.collaborative_notes }}" target="_blank">collaborative notes document</a>
> to jot down any ideas you come up with.
> > ## Ideas
> > Some reasons that are commonly cited are:
> > - If I share my code, people will find mistakes in it, and that would be embarrassing
> > - My software is badly built, or my code is messy, and it's embarrassing
> > - It takes time to learn how to share and do the sharing -- time I don't have
> > - I don't want to maintain my code or software, and I'd feel obliged to if I shared it
> > - My software won't be as impressive if people can see how it works
> > - People could use adapt my software for purposes I don't agree with
> > - I worked hard on this code and I don't want other people to benefit from my work

> ## Addressing concerns `10 min`
> We have a list of concerns that people in your workshops might have.
>
> Remember, it's not wrong to have concerns! We believe that sharing data and code
> is important and that the benefits outweigh the concerns, and we'd like to help
> you understand why and give you any encouragement you need.
> Here, we hope to provide some perspective on those concerns
>
> ## Focus on the concern that your code is not "good" enough to share `15 min`
> All programmer's experience anxiety sharing their code, it is not reserved to individuals 
> who class themselves as beginners or not "professional software developers". 
> If we are all aspiring to create good quality code in order to share it, it raises the question, 
> what makes code good?
> In your groups, think of examples of code you have seen or used that you thought was good, or easy to use. 
> What features or attributes did it have? Use the <a href="{{ site.collaborative_notes }}" target="_blank">collaborative notes document</a>
> to jot down any ideas you come up with.
>
>
> It is true that there are multiple ways to acheive the same goal, within the same programming language. 
> While some solutions may be more efficient, and some solutions more elegant, the primary objective is 
> that your code is robust and fit for purpose. Try not to feel too self conscious that your solution is 
> too simple, simplicity is not a negative. 
> 
> Another concern regarding quality is that your code is too messy. When you start writing a new script 
> it can be really challenging to make it look pretty as you focus on crafting the algorithm or computational routine and
> working out what commands you need to implement it. To be honest, it's hard to manage even these two things at once.  
> But this is not dissimilar to when we write a piece of prose (thesis, report, manuscript). Intially we focus on what we 
> want to say and how and as the content develops (or sometimes at the end) we turn our attention to formatting and checking 
> that the way it is structured and presented makes it really easy for someone to read.
>
> Essentially, it is not uncommon to have "messy" scripts along the way. But "cleaning" them up needn't be an arduous task, 
> and is a barrier we are all able to overcome. This can also be a great self-reflective process, where you learn for you next script, 
> where different components work best and you may find over time writing "tidier" scripts comes more naturally.
>
> Our objective today is to start this process. We will work on a script, and "clean" it up to be something that you feel confident to share. 
> The mechanism for sharing code will be covered in the next session.
>
>
> We want to acknowledge that sharing can be frightening or difficult, but highlight that it is worth doing anyway! 
> The first time is the scariest. As you start to share more frequently, it becomes part of your mindset that 
> "this script will be seen by someone else" and you code in a different (probably better) way. Therefore by being open to 
> sharing your work you will likely improve your own skillset as you aspire to share, useful high quality content.
